## The Legend of Zelda : A Dream to the Past

A dream to the Past is our take on the classic TLoZ: A link to the Past, where the core of the game will shift towards a more fast-paced, crammed with action style of game while maintaining the essence that makes TLoZ game. Fans as we are of roguelike games such as The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon , Roguelight and many more, we feel that the pace that TLoZ games can be pumped up a little bit in order to appeal to a different, more action driven demographic.

### Developers 

We are a team of 7 students from the Upc who are working on a rogue like game keeping the essence of The Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past. We hope you like it!!
