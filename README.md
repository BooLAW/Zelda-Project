Adaptation from Zelda "A link to the past" game made for our Videogames Degree

The Legend of Zelda: A dream to the Past is our take on the classic TLoZ: A link to the Past,
 where the core of the game will shift towards a more fast-paced,
 crammed with action style of game while maintaining the essence that makes TLoZ game. 
Fans as we are of roguelike games such as The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon ,
 Roguelight and many more, we feel that the pace that TLoZ games can be pumped up a 
little bit in order to appeal to a different, more action driven demographic.

HOW TO INSTALL, PLAY AND WIN

To donwload the game you need to go to (link) and click TLOZ.ADreamToThePast.zip, extract it in a folder and then
execute the executable. The game will begin with a intro of our group IceCrew. Then it will appear the main menu,
which consists of Dungeons mode (the game itself), Arena mode, and settings.

To win the game you need to complete at least 3 dungeons, in order to achieve 3 keys so the boss dungeon is
unlocked. After defeating the boss you will rescue Zelda.
